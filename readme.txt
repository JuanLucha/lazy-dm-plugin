Block for preparing roleplaying game sessions using the Lazy DM method from Mike Shea (more info here: https://slyflourish.com/)

== Description ==

Preparing a good roleplaying session is hard and time consuming. So many things to do upfront, things that your players don't have to worry about. It's fair that you can spend as little preparing the session as you would like to.

Mike Shea created a method to prepare a complete 4 hours game session in 30 minutes or less: The Lazy DM method. This method takes into account the most important elements that makes for a good roleplaying session (like secrets and clues, fantastic locations, among others) and gives you a comprehensive checklist to prepare it in record time.
